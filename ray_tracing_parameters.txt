%% Parameter file for SHeM ray tracing
% Most of the basic parameters can be specified here, although there is some 
% greater functionality available through directly editing the main script.
% refer to the seperate file for in depth descritions of parameters.
%
% Lines that start with '%' will be ignored, feel free to add your own comments.

%% Set up your virtual microscope
% stl models of the pinhole plate can also be used but must be specified
% manually in the simulation script in the current version.
Design working distance (mm): 1
Incidence angle (deg): 0
Type of scan: rectangular
Number of detectors: 4
Detector full axes (x,y): (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
Detector centres (x,y): (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)
Rotation angles (only needed if 'rotaions' scan used): (0, 72, 144, 216, 288)

%% Set up your source
% There are two models of the source, 'Uniform' source at the skimmer, or a
% 'Gaussian'. In the first case provide the maximum angular value, in the second
% case provide the angular standard deviation. A cosine effuse beam may also be
% modelled coming from the pinhole.
Number of Rays: 200000
Pinhole radius (mm): 0.001
Source model: Uniform
Angular source size (rad): 1e-4
Source standard deviation (rad): 0.1
Effuse beam: Off
Effuse size (relative to the direct beam): 1

%% Set up your sample
% There are a few inbuilt samples or you can provide your own stl file of a
% sample, options are: 'flat', 'sphere', 'custom', 'photoStereo'
% The scattering from the sample must also be defined, options:
% 'cosine', 'uniform', 'specular', 'broad_specular'. The latter 2 require
% parameters. 
%  - If you are using the 'sphere' option specify the radius of sphere.
%  - If using the 'flat' option specify the size of the flat square sample.
%  - If specifying your own sample specify the name and path to the stl file,
%    please use a file name and path without spaces
What type of sample are you useing: custom
Scattering: cosine
Reflectivity: 0.1
Standard deviation (deg): 90 
Sample description: Test sample
Working distance to place the sample at: 1
Sphere radius (mm): 0.1
Length of side of flat sample: 1
Custom sample stl file: simulations/aspect_ratio_test_02.stl

%% Set up your scan
% For now this assumes you are doing a 2D rectangular scan centering on the
% middle on the sample.
Pixel seperation (mm): 0.002
Scan range x (mm): 0.25
Scan range y (mm): 0.25
Ignore incidence angle in scan pattern: no

%% Other parameters
Label for the output directory (no spaces please): aspect_ratio_test02
Sould the C code be recompiled: false
