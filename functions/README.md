Functions for the SHeM simulation
=================================

The `functions` directory contains `.m` functions that are used as part of the
SHeM Ray Tracing Simulation. This file lists the functions in this directory
and goes through what they are used for.

There are two subdirectories here, one contains the gateway functions to mex
and the other contains functions that create specific samples.
